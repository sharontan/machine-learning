# Lending Club

We will be working with financial lending data from Lending Club. Lending Club is a marketplace for personal loans that matches borrowers who are seeking a loan with investors looking to lend money and make a return.

Most investors use a portfolio strategy to invest small amounts in many loans, with healthy mixes of low, medium, and high interest loans. We will focus on the mindset of a conservative investor who only wants to invest in loans that have a good chance of being paid off on time.

We will build a machine learning model that can predict if a borrower will pay off their loan on time.
