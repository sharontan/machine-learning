And will not let belief take hold of him\
Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:\
Therefore I have entreated him along\
With us to watch the minutes of this night;\
That if again this apparition come,\
He may approve our eyes and speak to it.\

\b \cf2 BERNARDO\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

Together with that fair and warlike form\
In which the majesty of buried Denmark\
Did sometimes march? by heaven I charge thee, speak!\

\b \cf2 BERNARDO\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 How now, Horatio! you tremble and look pale:\
Is not this something more than fantasy?\
What think you on't?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 HORATIO\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 Before my God, I might not this believe\
Without the sensible and true avouch\
Of mine own eyes.\

\b \cf2 MARCELLUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 HORATIO\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 As thou art to thyself:\
Such was the very armour he had on\
When he the ambitious Norway combated;\
So frown'd he once, when, in an angry parle,\
He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.\
'Tis strange.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 MARCELLUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,\
With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 HORATIO\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 In what particular thought to work I know not;\
But in the gross and scope of my opinion,\
This bodes some strange eruption to our state.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 MARCELLUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,\
Why this same strict and most observant watch\
So nightly toils the subject of the land,\
And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,\
And foreign mart for implements of war;\
Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task\
Does not divide the Sunday from the week;\
What might be toward, that this sweaty haste\
Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:\
Who is't that can inform me?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 HORATIO\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 That can I;\
At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,\
Whose image even but now appear'd to us,\
Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,\
Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,\
Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet--\
For so this side of our known world esteem'd him--\
Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal'd compact,\
Well ratified by law and heraldry,\
Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands\
Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror:\
Against the which, a moiety competent\
Was gaged by our king; which had return'd\
To the inheritance of Fortinbras,\
Had he been vanquisher; as, by the same covenant,\
And carriage of the article design'd,\
His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,\
Of unimproved mettle hot and full,\
Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there\
Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,\
For food and diet, to some enterprise\
That hath a stomach in't; which is no other--\
As it doth well appear unto our state--\
But to recover of us, by strong hand\
And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands\
So by his father lost: and this, I take it,\
Is the main motive of our preparations,\
The source of this our watch and the chief head\
Of this post-haste and romage in the land.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 BERNARDO\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 I think it be no other but e'en so:\
Well may it sort that this portentous figure\
Comes armed through our watch; so like the king\
That was and is the question of these wars.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 HORATIO\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.\
In the most high and palmy state of Rome,\
A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,\
The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead\
Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets:\
As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,\
Disasters in the sun; and the moist star\
Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands\
Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:\
And even the like precurse of fierce events,\
As harbingers preceding still the fates\
And prologue to the omen coming on,\
Have heaven and earth together demonstrated\
Unto our climatures and countrymen.--\
But soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\sa240\partightenfactor0

\i \cf2 Re-enter Ghost
\i0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0
\cf2 I'll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion!\
If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,\
Speak to me:\
If there be any good thing to be done,\
That may to thee do ease and grace to me,\
Speak to me:\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\sa240\partightenfactor0

\i \cf2 Cock crows
\i0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0
\cf2 If thou art privy to thy country's fate,\
Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid, O, speak!\
Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life\
Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,\
For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,\
Speak of it: stay, and speak! Stop it, Marcellus.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 MARCELLUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 Shall I strike at it with my partisan?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 HORATIO\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 Do, if it will not stand.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 BERNARDO\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\i \cf2 Exit Ghost
\i0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0
\cf2 We do it wrong, being so majestical,\
To offer it the show of violence;\
For it is, as the air, invulnerable,\
And our vain blows malicious mockery.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 BERNARDO\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 It was about to speak, when the cock crew.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 HORATIO\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 And then it started like a guilty thing\
Upon a fearful summons. I have heard,\
The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,\
Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat\
Awake the god of day; and, at his warning,\
Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,\
The extravagant and erring spirit hies\
To his confine: and of the truth herein\
This present object made probation.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 MARCELLUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 It faded on the crowing of the cock.\
Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes\
Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,\
The bird of dawning singeth all night long:\
And then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad;\
The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,\
No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,\
So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 HORATIO\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 So have I heard and do in part believe it.\
But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,\
Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill:\
Break we our watch up; and by my advice,\
Let us impart what we have seen to-night\
Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,\
This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.\
Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,\
As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 MARCELLUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know\
Where we shall find him most conveniently.\

\b \cf2 KING CLAUDIUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death\
The memory be green, and that it us befitted\
To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom\
To be contracted in one brow of woe,\
Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature\
That we with wisest sorrow think on him,\
Together with remembrance of ourselves.\
Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,\
The imperial jointress to this warlike state,\
Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,--\
With an auspicious and a dropping eye,\
With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,\
In equal scale weighing delight and dole,--\
Taken to wife: nor have we herein barr'd\
Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone\
With this affair along. For all, our thanks.\
Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,\
Holding a weak supposal of our worth,\
Or thinking by our late dear brother's death\
Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,\
Colleagued with the dream of his advantage,\
He hath not fail'd to pester us with message,\
Importing the surrender of those lands\
Lost by his father, with all bonds of law,\
To our most valiant brother. So much for him.\
Now for ourself and for this time of meeting:\
Thus much the business is: we have here writ\
To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,--\
Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears\
Of this his nephew's purpose,--to suppress\
His further gait herein; in that the levies,\
The lists and full proportions, are all made\
Out of his subject: and we here dispatch\
You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand,\
For bearers of this greeting to old Norway;\
Giving to you no further personal power\
To business with the king, more than the scope\
Of these delated articles allow.\
Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.\

\cf2 And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?\
You told us of some suit; what is't, Laertes?\
You cannot speak of reason to the Dane,\
And loose your voice: what wouldst thou beg, Laertes,\
That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?\
The head is not more native to the heart,\
The hand more instrumental to the mouth,\
Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.\
What wouldst thou have, Laertes?\

\b \cf2 LAERTES\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 My dread lord,\
Your leave and favour to return to France;\
From whence though willingly I came to Denmark,\
To show my duty in your coronation,\
Yet now, I must confess, that duty done,\
My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France\
And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.\

\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 LORD POLONIUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave\
By laboursome petition, and at last\
Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent:\
I do beseech you, give him leave to go.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 KING CLAUDIUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,\
And thy best graces spend it at thy will!\
But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son,--\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 HAMLET\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 [Aside] A little more than kin, and less than kind.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 KING CLAUDIUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 How is it that the clouds still hang on you?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 HAMLET\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 Not so, my lord; I am too much i' the sun.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 QUEEN GERTRUDE\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,\
And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.\
Do not for ever with thy vailed lids\
Seek for thy noble father in the dust:\
Thou know'st 'tis common; all that lives must die,\
Passing through nature to eternity.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 HAMLET\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 Ay, madam, it is common.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 QUEEN GERTRUDE\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 If it be,\
Why seems it so particular with thee?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 HAMLET\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 Seems, madam! nay it is; I know not 'seems.'\
'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,\
Nor customary suits of solemn black,\
Nor windy suspiration of forced breath,\
No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,\
Nor the dejected 'havior of the visage,\
Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,\
That can denote me truly: these indeed seem,\
For they are actions that a man might play:\
But I have that within which passeth show;\
These but the trappings and the suits of woe.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 KING CLAUDIUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,\
To give these mourning duties to your father:\
But, you must know, your father lost a father;\
That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound\
In filial obligation for some term\
To do obsequious sorrow: but to persever\
In obstinate condolement is a course\
Of impious stubbornness; 'tis unmanly grief;\
It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,\
A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,\
An understanding simple and unschool'd:\
For what we know must be and is as common\
As any the most vulgar thing to sense,\
Why should we in our peevish opposition\
Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,\
A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,\
To reason most absurd: whose common theme\
Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,\
From the first corse till he that died to-day,\
'This must be so.' We pray you, throw to earth\
This unprevailing woe, and think of us\
As of a father: for let the world take note,\
You are the most immediate to our throne;\
And with no less nobility of love\
Than that which dearest father bears his son,\
Do I impart toward you. For your intent\
In going back to school in Wittenberg,\
It is most retrograde to our desire:\
And we beseech you, bend you to remain\
Here, in the cheer and comfort of our eye,\
Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 QUEEN GERTRUDE\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet:\
I pray thee, stay with us; go not to Wittenberg.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 HAMLET\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 I shall in all my best obey you, madam.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 KING CLAUDIUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply:\
Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come;\
This gentle and unforced accord of Hamlet\
Sits smiling to my heart: in grace whereof,\
No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day,\
But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,\
And the king's rouse the heavens all bruit again,\
Re-speaking earthly thunder. Come away.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\sa240\partightenfactor0

\i \cf2 Exeunt all but HAMLET

\b \cf2 HAMLET\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 O, that this too too solid flesh would melt\
Thaw and resolve itself into a dew!\
Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd\
His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!\
How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable,\
Seem to me all the uses of this world!\
Fie on't! ah fie! 'tis an unweeded garden,\
That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature\
Possess it merely. That it should come to this!\
But two months dead: nay, not so much, not two:\
So excellent a king; that was, to this,\
Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother\
That he might not beteem the winds of heaven\
Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!\
Must I remember? why, she would hang on him,\
As if increase of appetite had grown\
By what it fed on: and yet, within a month--\
Let me not think on't--Frailty, thy name is woman!--\
A little month, or ere those shoes were old\
With which she follow'd my poor father's body,\
Like Niobe, all tears:--why she, even she--\
O, God! a beast, that wants discourse of reason,\
Would have mourn'd longer--married with my uncle,\
My father's brother, but no more like my father\
Than I to Hercules: within a month:\
Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears\
Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,\
She married. O, most wicked speed, to post\
With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!\
It is not nor it cannot come to good:\
But break, my heart; for I must hold my tongue.\

\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 HAMLET\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 I would not hear your enemy say so,\
Nor shall you do mine ear that violence,\
To make it truster of your own report\
Against yourself: I know you are no truant.\
But what is your affair in Elsinore?\
We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.\

\b0 \cf2 I pray thee, do not mock me, fellow-student;\
I think it was to see my mother's wedding.\

\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 HAMLET\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 Thrift, thrift, Horatio! the funeral baked meats\
Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.\
Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven\
Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!\
My father!--methinks I see my father.\

\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 Season your admiration for awhile\
With an attent ear, till I may deliver,\
Upon the witness of these gentlemen,\
This marvel to you.\

\b \cf2 HORATIO\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 Two nights together had these gentlemen,\
Marcellus and Bernardo, on their watch,\
In the dead vast and middle of the night,\
Been thus encounter'd. A figure like your father,\
Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,\
Appears before them, and with solemn march\
Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk'd\
By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,\
Within his truncheon's length; whilst they, distilled\
Almost to jelly with the act of fear,\
Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me\
In dreadful secrecy impart they did;\
And I with them the third night kept the watch;\
Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,\
Form of the thing, each word made true and good,\
The apparition comes: I knew your father;\
These hands are not more like.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 HAMLET\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 Did you not speak to it?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 HORATIO\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 My lord, I did;\
But answer made it none: yet once methought\
It lifted up its head and did address\
Itself to motion, like as it would speak;\
But even then the morning cock crew loud,\
And at the sound it shrunk in haste away,\
And vanish'd from our sight.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 HAMLET\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;\
And we did think it writ down in our duty\
To let you know of it.\

\b \cf2 LAERTES\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 Think it no more;\
For nature, crescent, does not grow alone\
In thews and bulk, but, as this temple waxes,\
The inward service of the mind and soul\
Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,\
And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch\
The virtue of his will: but you must fear,\
His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;\
For he himself is subject to his birth:\
He may not, as unvalued persons do,\
Carve for himself; for on his choice depends\
The safety and health of this whole state;\
And therefore must his choice be circumscribed\
Unto the voice and yielding of that body\
Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,\
It fits your wisdom so far to believe it\
As he in his particular act and place\
May give his saying deed; which is no further\
Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.\
Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain,\
If with too credent ear you list his songs,\
Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open\
To his unmaster'd importunity.\
Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,\
And keep you in the rear of your affection,\
Out of the shot and danger of desire.\
The chariest maid is prodigal enough,\
If she unmask her beauty to the moon:\
Virtue itself 'scapes not calumnious strokes:\
The canker galls the infants of the spring,\
Too oft before their buttons be disclosed,\
And in the morn and liquid dew of youth\
Contagious blastments are most imminent.\
Be wary then; best safety lies in fear:\
Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.\

\b0 \cf2 I shall the effect of this good lesson keep,\
As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,\
Do not, as some ungracious pastors do,\
Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven;\
Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,\
Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads,\
And recks not his own rede.\

\b \cf2 LORD POLONIUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 Yet here, Laertes! aboard, aboard, for shame!\
The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,\
And you are stay'd for. There; my blessing with thee!\
And these few precepts in thy memory\
See thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,\
Nor any unproportioned thought his act.\
Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.\
Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,\
Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel;\
But do not dull thy palm with entertainment\
Of each new-hatch'd, unfledged comrade. Beware\
Of entrance to a quarrel, but being in,\
Bear't that the opposed may beware of thee.\
Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice;\
Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.\
Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,\
But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;\
For the apparel oft proclaims the man,\
And they in France of the best rank and station\
Are of a most select and generous chief in that.\
Neither a borrower nor a lender be;\
For loan oft loses both itself and friend,\
And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.\
This above all: to thine ownself be true,\
And it must follow, as the night the day,\
Thou canst not then be false to any man.\
Farewell: my blessing season this in thee!\

\b \cf2 LORD POLONIUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 Marry, well bethought:\
'Tis told me, he hath very oft of late\
Given private time to you; and you yourself\
Have of your audience been most free and bounteous:\
If it be so, as so 'tis put on me,\
And that in way of caution, I must tell you,\
You do not understand yourself so clearly\
As it behoves my daughter and your honour.\
What is between you? give me up the truth.\

\b \cf2 OPHELIA\

Of his affection to me.\

\b \cf2 LORD POLONIUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 Affection! pooh! you speak like a green girl,\
Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.\
Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?\

\b \cf2 OPHELIA\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 LORD POLONIUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 Marry, I'll teach you: think yourself a baby;\
That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,\
Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly;\
Or--not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,\
Running it thus--you'll tender me a fool.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 OPHELIA\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 My lord, he hath importuned me with love\
In honourable fashion.\

\b \cf2 LORD POLONIUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

With almost all the holy vows of heaven.\

\b \cf2 LORD POLONIUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 Ay, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know,\
When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul\
Lends the tongue vows: these blazes, daughter,\
Giving more light than heat, extinct in both,\
Even in their promise, as it is a-making,\
You must not take for fire. From this time\
Be somewhat scanter of your maiden presence;\
Set your entreatments at a higher rate\
Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,\
Believe so much in him, that he is young\
And with a larger tether may he walk\
Than may be given you: in few, Ophelia,\
Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,\
Not of that dye which their investments show,\
But mere implorators of unholy suits,\
Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,\
The better to beguile. This is for all:\
I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth,\
Have you so slander any moment leisure,\
As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.\
Look to't, I charge you: come your ways.\

\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 The king doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,\
Keeps wassail, and the swaggering up-spring reels;\
And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,\
The kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out\
The triumph of his pledge.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 HORATIO\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 HAMLET\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 Ay, marry, is't:\
But to my mind, though I am native here\
And to the manner born, it is a custom\
More honour'd in the breach than the observance.\
This heavy-headed revel east and west\
Makes us traduced and tax'd of other nations:\
They clepe us drunkards, and with swinish phrase\
Soil our addition; and indeed it takes\
From our achievements, though perform'd at height,\
The pith and marrow of our attribute.\
So, oft it chances in particular men,\
That for some vicious mole of nature in them,\
As, in their birth--wherein they are not guilty,\
Since nature cannot choose his origin--\
By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,\
Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,\
Or by some habit that too much o'er-leavens\
The form of plausive manners, that these men,\
Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,\
Being nature's livery, or fortune's star,--\
Their virtues else--be they as pure as grace,\
As infinite as man may undergo--\
Shall in the general censure take corruption\
From that particular fault: the dram of eale\
Doth all the noble substance of a doubt\
To his own scandal.\

Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,\
Be thy intents wicked or charitable,\
Thou comest in such a questionable shape\
That I will speak to thee: I'll call thee Hamlet,\
King, father, royal Dane: O, answer me!\
Let me not burst in ignorance; but tell\
Why thy canonized bones, hearsed in death,\
Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre,\
Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,\
Hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws,\
To cast thee up again. What may this mean,\
That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel\
Revisit'st thus the glimpses of the moon,\
Making night hideous; and we fools of nature\
So horridly to shake our disposition\
With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?\
Say, why is this? wherefore? what should we do?\

Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff\
That beetles o'er his base into the sea,\
And there assume some other horrible form,\
Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason\
And draw you into madness? think of it:\
The very place puts toys of desperation,\
Without more motive, into every brain\
That looks so many fathoms to the sea\
And hears it roar beneath.\

Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature\
Are burnt and purged away. But that I am forbid\
To tell the secrets of my prison-house,\
I could a tale unfold whose lightest word\
Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,\
Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,\
Thy knotted and combined locks to part\
And each particular hair to stand on end,\
Like quills upon the fretful porpentine:\
But this eternal blazon must not be\
To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!\

Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear:\
'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,\
A serpent stung me; so the whole ear of Denmark\
Is by a forged process of my death\
Rankly abused: but know, thou noble youth,\
The serpent that did sting thy father's life\
Now wears his crown.\

\b0 \cf2 Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,\
With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts,--\
O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power\
So to seduce!--won to his shameful lust\
The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen:\
O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there!\
From me, whose love was of that dignity\
That it went hand in hand even with the vow\
I made to her in marriage, and to decline\
Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor\
To those of mine!\
But virtue, as it never will be moved,\
Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,\
So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,\
Will sate itself in a celestial bed,\
And prey on garbage.\
But, soft! methinks I scent the morning air;\
Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,\
My custom always of the afternoon,\
Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,\
With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial,\
And in the porches of my ears did pour\
The leperous distilment; whose effect\
Holds such an enmity with blood of man\
That swift as quicksilver it courses through\
The natural gates and alleys of the body,\
And with a sudden vigour doth posset\
And curd, like eager droppings into milk,\
The thin and wholesome blood: so did it mine;\
And a most instant tetter bark'd about,\
Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust,\
All my smooth body.\
Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand\
Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd:\
Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,\
Unhousel'd, disappointed, unanel'd,\
No reckoning made, but sent to my account\
With all my imperfections on my head:\
O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!\
If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not;\
Let not the royal bed of Denmark be\
A couch for luxury and damned incest.\
But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,\
Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive\
Against thy mother aught: leave her to heaven\
And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge,\
To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once!\
The glow-worm shows the matin to be near,\
And 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire:\
Adieu, adieu! Hamlet, remember me.\

But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee!\
Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat\
In this distracted globe. Remember thee!\
Yea, from the table of my memory\
I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,\
All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past,\
That youth and observation copied there;\
And thy commandment all alone shall live\
Within the book and volume of my brain,\
Unmix'd with baser matter: yes, by heaven!\

O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!\

\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 Marry, well said; very well said. Look you, sir,\
Inquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;\
And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,\
What company, at what expense; and finding\
By this encompassment and drift of question\
That they do know my son, come you more nearer\
Than your particular demands will touch it:\
Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;\
As thus, 'I know his father and his friends,\
And in part him: ' do you mark this, Reynaldo?\

But, if't be he I mean, he's very wild;\
Addicted so and so:' and there put on him\
What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank\
As may dishonour him; take heed of that;\
But, sir, such wanton, wild and usual slips\
As are companions noted and most known\
To youth and liberty.\

You must not put another scandal on him,\
That he is open to incontinency;\

That they may seem the taints of liberty,\
The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,\

\b \cf2 LORD POLONIUS\

And I believe, it is a fetch of wit:\
You laying these slight sullies on my son,\
As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' the working, Mark you,\
Your party in converse, him you would sound,\
Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes\
The youth you breathe of guilty, be assured\
He closes with you in this consequence;\
'Good sir,' or so, or 'friend,' or 'gentleman,'\
According to the phrase or the addition\
Of man and country.\

\b \cf2 LORD POLONIUS\

\b0 \cf2 At 'closes in the consequence,' ay, marry;\
He closes thus: 'I know the gentleman;\
I saw him yesterday, or t' other day,\
Or then, or then; with such, or such; and, as you say,\
There was a' gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;\
There falling out at tennis:' or perchance,\
'I saw him enter such a house of sale,'\
Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.\
See you now;\
Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth:\
And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,\
With windlasses and with assays of bias,\
By indirections find directions out:\

Shall you my son. You have me, have you not?\

\b0 \cf2 He took me by the wrist and held me hard;\
Then goes he to the length of all his arm;\
And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,\
He falls to such perusal of my face\
As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so;\
At last, a little shaking of mine arm\
And thrice his head thus waving up and down,\
He raised a sigh so piteous and profound\
As it did seem to shatter all his bulk\
And end his being: that done, he lets me go:\
And, with his head over his shoulder turn'd,\
He seem'd to find his way without his eyes;\
For out o' doors he went without their helps,\
And, to the last, bended their light on me.\

\b \cf2 LORD POLONIUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 Come, go with me: I will go seek the king.\
This is the very ecstasy of love,\
Whose violent property fordoes itself\
And leads the will to desperate undertakings\
As oft as any passion under heaven\
That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.\
What, have you given him any hard words of late?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 OPHELIA\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 No, my good lord, but, as you did command,\
I did repel his fetters and denied\
His access to me.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 LORD POLONIUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 That hath made him mad.\
I am sorry that with better heed and judgment\
I had not quoted him: I fear'd he did but trifle,\
And meant to wreck thee; but, beshrew my jealousy!\
By heaven, it is as proper to our age\
To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions\
As it is common for the younger sort\
To lack discretion. Come, go we to the king:\
This must be known; which, being kept close, might\
move\
More grief to hide than hate to utter love.\

\b \cf2 KING CLAUDIUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern!\
Moreover that we much did long to see you,\
The need we have to use you did provoke\
Our hasty sending. Something have you heard\
Of Hamlet's transformation; so call it,\
Sith nor the exterior nor the inward man\
Resembles that it was. What it should be,\
More than his father's death, that thus hath put him\
So much from the understanding of himself,\
I cannot dream of: I entreat you both,\
That, being of so young days brought up with him,\
And sith so neighbour'd to his youth and havior,\
That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court\
Some little time: so by your companies\
To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather,\
So much as from occasion you may glean,\
Whether aught, to us unknown, afflicts him thus,\
That, open'd, lies within our remedy.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 QUEEN GERTRUDE\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you;\
And sure I am two men there are not living\
To whom he more adheres. If it will please you\
To show us so much gentry and good will\
As to expend your time with us awhile,\
For the supply and profit of our hope,\
Your visitation shall receive such thanks\
As fits a king's remembrance.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 ROSENCRANTZ\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 Both your majesties\

Than to entreaty.\

To be commanded.\

I hold my duty, as I hold my soul,\
Both to my God and to my gracious king:\
And I do think, or else this brain of mine\
Hunts not the trail of policy so sure\
As it hath used to do, that I have found\
The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.\

\b \cf2 QUEEN GERTRUDE\

\cf2 Welcome, my good friends!\
Say, Voltimand, what from our brother Norway?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 VOLTIMAND\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 Most fair return of greetings and desires.\
Upon our first, he sent out to suppress\
His nephew's levies; which to him appear'd\
To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack;\
But, better look'd into, he truly found\
It was against your highness: whereat grieved,\
That so his sickness, age and impotence\
Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests\
On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys;\
Receives rebuke from Norway, and in fine\
Makes vow before his uncle never more\
To give the assay of arms against your majesty.\
Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,\
Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee,\
And his commission to employ those soldiers,\
So levied as before, against the Polack:\
With an entreaty, herein further shown,\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\sa240\partightenfactor0

\i \cf2 Giving a paper
\i0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0
\cf2 That it might please you to give quiet pass\
Through your dominions for this enterprise,\
On such regards of safety and allowance\
As therein are set down.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 KING CLAUDIUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 It likes us well;\
And at our more consider'd time well read,\
Answer, and think upon this business.\
Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour:\
Go to your rest; at night we'll feast together:\
Most welcome home!\

\b \cf2 LORD POLONIUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 This business is well ended.\
My liege, and madam, to expostulate\
What majesty should be, what duty is,\
Why day is day, night night, and time is time,\
Were nothing but to waste night, day and time.\
Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,\
And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,\
I will be brief: your noble son is mad:\
Mad call I it; for, to define true madness,\
What is't but to be nothing else but mad?\
But let that go.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 QUEEN GERTRUDE\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 LORD POLONIUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 Madam, I swear I use no art at all.\
That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;\
And pity 'tis 'tis true: a foolish figure;\
But farewell it, for I will use no art.\
Mad let us grant him, then: and now remains\
That we find out the cause of this effect,\
Or rather say, the cause of this defect,\
For this effect defective comes by cause:\
Thus it remains, and the remainder thus. Perpend.\
I have a daughter--have while she is mine--\
Who, in her duty and obedience, mark,\
Hath given me this: now gather, and surmise.\

I have not art to reckon my groans: but that\
I love thee best, O most best, believe it. Adieu.\
'Thine evermore most dear lady, whilst\
this machine is to him, HAMLET.'\
This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me,\
And more above, hath his solicitings,\
As they fell out by time, by means and place,\
All given to mine ear.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 KING CLAUDIUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 LORD POLONIUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 KING CLAUDIUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 As of a man faithful and honourable.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 LORD POLONIUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 I would fain prove so. But what might you think,\
When I had seen this hot love on the wing--\
As I perceived it, I must tell you that,\
Before my daughter told me--what might you,\
Or my dear majesty your queen here, think,\
If I had play'd the desk or table-book,\
Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,\
Or look'd upon this love with idle sight;\
What might you think? No, I went round to work,\
And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:\
'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star;\
This must not be:' and then I precepts gave her,\
That she should lock herself from his resort,\
Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.\
Which done, she took the fruits of my advice;\
And he, repulsed--a short tale to make--\
Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,\
Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,\
Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,\
Into the madness wherein now he raves,\
And all we mourn for.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 KING CLAUDIUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 QUEEN GERTRUDE\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 It may be, very likely.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 LORD POLONIUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 Hath there been such a time--I'd fain know that--\
That I have positively said 'Tis so,'\
When it proved otherwise?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 KING CLAUDIUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 Not that I know.\

\b \cf2 LORD POLONIUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 [Pointing to his head and shoulder]\
Take this from this, if this be otherwise:\

Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed\
Within the centre.\

\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 LORD POLONIUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 You know, sometimes he walks four hours together\
Here in the lobby.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 LORD POLONIUS\

\b0 \cf2 At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him:\
Be you and I behind an arras then;\
Mark the encounter: if he love her not\
And be not from his reason fall'n thereon,\
Let me be no assistant for a state,\
But keep a farm and carters.\

\b \cf2 HAMLET\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 Ay, sir; to be honest, as this world goes, is to be\
one man picked out of ten thousand.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 LORD POLONIUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

was a fishmonger: he is far gone, far gone: and\
truly in my youth I suffered much extremity for\
love; very near this. I'll speak to him again.\

\b \cf2 HAMLET\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 Slanders, sir: for the satirical rogue says here\
that old men have grey beards, that their faces are\
wrinkled, their eyes purging thick amber and\
plum-tree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of\
wit, together with most weak hams: all which, sir,\
though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet\
I hold it not honesty to have it thus set down, for\
yourself, sir, should be old as I am, if like a crab\
you could go backward.\

\b0 \cf2 Why, then, 'tis none to you; for there is nothing\

it is a prison.\

\b0 \cf2 Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I\
thank you: and sure, dear friends, my thanks are\
too dear a halfpenny. Were you not sent for? Is it\
your own inclining? Is it a free visitation? Come,\

\b \cf2 HAMLET\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 Why, any thing, but to the purpose. You were sent\
for; and there is a kind of confession in your looks\
which your modesties have not craft enough to colour:\
I know the good king and queen have sent for you.\

\b \cf2 HAMLET\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 That you must teach me. But let me conjure you, by\
the rights of our fellowship, by the consonancy of\
our youth, by the obligation of our ever-preserved\
love, and by what more dear a better proposer could\
charge you withal, be even and direct with me,\
whether you were sent for, or no?\

\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation\
prevent your discovery, and your secrecy to the king\
and queen moult no feather. I have of late--but\
wherefore I know not--lost all my mirth, forgone all\
custom of exercises; and indeed it goes so heavily\
with my disposition that this goodly frame, the\
earth, seems to me a sterile promontory, this most\
excellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave\
o'erhanging firmament, this majestical roof fretted\
with golden fire, why, it appears no other thing to\
me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours.\
What a piece of work is a man! how noble in reason!\
how infinite in faculty! in form and moving how\
express and admirable! in action how like an angel!\
in apprehension how like a god! the beauty of the\
world! the paragon of animals! And yet, to me,\
what is this quintessence of dust? man delights not\
me: no, nor woman neither, though by your smiling\
you seem to say so.\

\b \cf2 ROSENCRANTZ\

\b \cf2 HAMLET\

\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 ROSENCRANTZ\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what\
lenten entertainment the players shall receive from\
you: we coted them on the way; and hither are they\
coming, to offer you service.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 HAMLET\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 He that plays the king shall be welcome; his majesty\
shall have tribute of me; the adventurous knight\
shall use his foil and target; the lover shall not\
sigh gratis; the humourous man shall end his part\
in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose\
lungs are tickled o' the sere; and the lady shall\
say her mind freely, or the blank verse shall halt\
for't. What players are they?\

\b \cf2 HAMLET\

in reputation and profit, was better both ways.\

\b \cf2 ROSENCRANTZ\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

late innovation.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 HAMLET\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was\
in the city? are they so followed?\

\b \cf2 ROSENCRANTZ\

\b \cf2 ROSENCRANTZ\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace: but\
there is, sir, an aery of children, little eyases,\
that cry out on the top of question, and are most\
tyrannically clapped for't: these are now the\
fashion, and so berattle the common stages--so they\
call them--that many wearing rapiers are afraid of\
goose-quills and dare scarce come thither.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 HAMLET\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 What, are they children? who maintains 'em? how are\
they escoted? Will they pursue the quality no\
longer than they can sing? will they not say\
afterwards, if they should grow themselves to common\
players--as it is most like, if their means are no\
better--their writers do them wrong, to make them\
exclaim against their own succession?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 'Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and\
the nation holds it no sin to tarre them to\
controversy: there was, for a while, no money bid\
for argument, unless the poet and the player went to\
cuffs in the question.\

come then: the appurtenance of welcome is fashion\
and ceremony: let me comply with you in this garb,\
lest my extent to the players, which, I tell you,\

comest thou to beard me in Denmark? What, my young\
lady and mistress! By'r lady, your ladyship is\
nearer to heaven than when I saw you last, by the\
altitude of a chopine. Pray God, your voice, like\
apiece of uncurrent gold, be not cracked within the\
ring. Masters, you are all welcome. We'll e'en\

\b \cf2 HAMLET\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was\
never acted; or, if it was, not above once; for the\
play, I remember, pleased not the million; 'twas\
caviare to the general: but it was--as I received\
it, and others, whose judgments in such matters\
cried in the top of mine--an excellent play, well\
digested in the scenes, set down with as much\
modesty as cunning. I remember, one said there\
were no sallets in the lines to make the matter\
savoury, nor no matter in the phrase that might\
indict the author of affectation; but called it an\
honest method, as wholesome as sweet, and by very\
much more handsome than fine. One speech in it I\
chiefly loved: 'twas Aeneas' tale to Dido; and\
thereabout of it especially, where he speaks of\
Priam's slaughter: if it live in your memory, begin\
at this line: let me see, let me see--\
'The rugged Pyrrhus, like the Hyrcanian beast,'--\
it is not so:--it begins with Pyrrhus:--\
'The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,\
Black as his purpose, did the night resemble\
When he lay couched in the ominous horse,\
Hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd\
With heraldry more dismal; head to foot\
Now is he total gules; horridly trick'd\
With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,\
Baked and impasted with the parching streets,\
That lend a tyrannous and damned light\
To their lord's murder: roasted in wrath and fire,\
And thus o'er-sized with coagulate gore,\
With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus\

Striking too short at Greeks; his antique sword,\
Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,\
Repugnant to command: unequal match'd,\
Pyrrhus at Priam drives; in rage strikes wide;\
But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword\
The unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,\
Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top\
Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash\
Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear: for, lo! his sword,\
Which was declining on the milky head\
Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' the air to stick:\
So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,\
And like a neutral to his will and matter,\
Did nothing.\
But, as we often see, against some storm,\
A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,\
The bold winds speechless and the orb below\
As hush as death, anon the dreadful thunder\
Doth rend the region, so, after Pyrrhus' pause,\
Aroused vengeance sets him new a-work;\
And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall\
On Mars's armour forged for proof eterne\
With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword\
Now falls on Priam.\
Out, out, thou strumpet, Fortune! All you gods,\
In general synod 'take away her power;\
Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,\
And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,\
As low as to the fiends!'\

O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!\
Is it not monstrous that this player here,\
But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,\
Could force his soul so to his own conceit\
That from her working all his visage wann'd,\
Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect,\
A broken voice, and his whole function suiting\
With forms to his conceit? and all for nothing!\
For Hecuba!\
What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,\
That he should weep for her? What would he do,\
Had he the motive and the cue for passion\
That I have? He would drown the stage with tears\
And cleave the general ear with horrid speech,\
Make mad the guilty and appal the free,\
Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed\
The very faculties of eyes and ears. Yet I,\
A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak,\
Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,\
And can say nothing; no, not for a king,\
Upon whose property and most dear life\
A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?\
Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?\
Plucks off my beard, and blows it in my face?\
Tweaks me by the nose? gives me the lie i' the throat,\
As deep as to the lungs? who does me this?\
Ha!\
'Swounds, I should take it: for it cannot be\
But I am pigeon-liver'd and lack gall\
To make oppression bitter, or ere this\
I should have fatted all the region kites\
With this slave's offal: bloody, bawdy villain!\
Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!\
O, vengeance!\
Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,\
That I, the son of a dear father murder'd,\
Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,\
Must, like a whore, unpack my heart with words,\
And fall a-cursing, like a very drab,\
A scullion!\
Fie upon't! foh! About, my brain! I have heard\
That guilty creatures sitting at a play\
Have by the very cunning of the scene\
Been struck so to the soul that presently\
They have proclaim'd their malefactions;\
For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak\
With most miraculous organ. I'll have these players\
Play something like the murder of my father\
Before mine uncle: I'll observe his looks;\
I'll tent him to the quick: if he but blench,\
I know my course. The spirit that I have seen\
May be the devil: and the devil hath power\
To assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps\
Out of my weakness and my melancholy,\
As he is very potent with such spirits,\
Abuses me to damn me: I'll have grounds\
More relative than this: the play 's the thing\
Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king.\

\b \cf2 HAMLET\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 To be, or not to be, that is the question,\
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer\
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,\
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,\
And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep;\
No more; and by a sleep to say we end\
The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks\
That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation\
Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;\
To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub;\
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come\
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,\
Must give us pause: there's the respect\
That makes calamity of so long life;\
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,\
The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,\
The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,\
The insolence of office and the spurns\
That patient merit of the unworthy takes,\
When he himself might his quietus make\
With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,\
To grunt and sweat under a weary life,\
But that the dread of something after death,\
The undiscover'd country from whose bourn\
No traveller returns, puzzles the will\
And makes us rather bear those ills we have\
Than fly to others that we know not of?\
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;\
And thus the native hue of resolution\
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,\
And enterprises of great pith and moment\
With this regard their currents turn awry,\
And lose the name of action.--Soft you now!\
The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons\
Be all my sins remember'd.\

\b0 \cf2 O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!\
The courtier's, soldier's, scholar's, eye, tongue, sword;\
The expectancy and rose of the fair state,\
The glass of fashion and the mould of form,\
The observed of all observers, quite, quite down!\
And I, of ladies most deject and wretched,\
That suck'd the honey of his music vows,\
Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,\
Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh;\
That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth\
Blasted with ecstasy: O, woe is me,\
To have seen what I have seen, see what I see!\

\b0 \cf2 Love! his affections do not that way tend;\
Nor what he spake, though it lack'd form a little,\
Was not like madness. There's something in his soul,\
O'er which his melancholy sits on brood;\
And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose\
Will be some danger: which for to prevent,\
I have in quick determination\
Thus set it down: he shall with speed to England,\
For the demand of our neglected tribute\
Haply the seas and countries different\
With variable objects shall expel\
This something-settled matter in his heart,\
Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus\
From fashion of himself. What think you on't?\

\b \cf2 LORD POLONIUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 It shall do well: but yet do I believe\
The origin and commencement of his grief\
Sprung from neglected love. How now, Ophelia!\
You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said;\
We heard it all. My lord, do as you please;\
But, if you hold it fit, after the play\
Let his queen mother all alone entreat him\
To show his grief: let her be round with him;\
And I'll be placed, so please you, in the ear\
Of all their conference. If she find him not,\
To England send him, or confine him where\
Your wisdom best shall think.\

\b \cf2 HAMLET\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to\
you, trippingly on the tongue: but if you mouth it,\
as many of your players do, I had as lief the\
town-crier spoke my lines. Nor do not saw the air\
too much with your hand, thus, but use all gently;\
for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say,\
the whirlwind of passion, you must acquire and beget\
a temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it\
offends me to the soul to hear a robustious\
periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to\
very rags, to split the ears of the groundlings, who\
for the most part are capable of nothing but\
inexplicable dumbshows and noise: I would have such\
a fellow whipped for o'erdoing Termagant; it\
out-herods Herod: pray you, avoid it.\

\b \cf2 HAMLET\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 Be not too tame neither, but let your own discretion\
be your tutor: suit the action to the word, the\
word to the action; with this special o'erstep not\
the modesty of nature: for any thing so overdone is\
from the purpose of playing, whose end, both at the\
first and now, was and is, to hold, as 'twere, the\
mirror up to nature; to show virtue her own feature,\
scorn her own image, and the very age and body of\
the time his form and pressure. Now this overdone,\
or come tardy off, though it make the unskilful\
laugh, cannot but make the judicious grieve; the\
censure of the which one must in your allowance\
o'erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be\
players that I have seen play, and heard others\
praise, and that highly, not to speak it profanely,\
that, neither having the accent of Christians nor\
the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so\
strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of\
nature's journeymen had made men and not made them\
well, they imitated humanity so abominably.\

\b \cf2 HAMLET\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 O, reform it altogether. And let those that play\
your clowns speak no more than is set down for them;\
for there be of them that will themselves laugh, to\
set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh\
too; though, in the mean time, some necessary\
question of the play be then to be considered:\
that's villanous, and shows a most pitiful ambition\
in the fool that uses it. Go, make you ready.\

\b0 \cf2 Nay, do not think I flatter;\
For what advancement may I hope from thee\
That no revenue hast but thy good spirits,\
To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter'd?\
No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp,\
And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee\
Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?\
Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice\
And could of men distinguish, her election\
Hath seal'd thee for herself; for thou hast been\
As one, in suffering all, that suffers nothing,\
A man that fortune's buffets and rewards\
Hast ta'en with equal thanks: and blest are those\
Whose blood and judgment are so well commingled,\
That they are not a pipe for fortune's finger\
To sound what stop she please. Give me that man\
That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him\
In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart,\
As I do thee.--Something too much of this.--\
There is a play to-night before the king;\
One scene of it comes near the circumstance\
Which I have told thee of my father's death:\
I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,\
Even with the very comment of thy soul\
Observe mine uncle: if his occulted guilt\
Do not itself unkennel in one speech,\
It is a damned ghost that we have seen,\
And my imaginations are as foul\
As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note;\
For I mine eyes will rivet to his face,\
And after we will both our judgments join\
In censure of his seeming.\

He takes her up, and declines his head upon her neck: lays him down upon a bank of flowers: she, seeing him asleep, leaves him. Anon comes in a fellow, takes off his crown, kisses it, and pours poison in the King's ears, and exit. The Queen returns; finds the King dead, and makes passionate action. The Poisoner, with some two or three Mutes, comes in again, seeming to lament with her. The dead body is carried away. The Poisoner wooes the Queen with gifts: she seems loath and unwilling awhile, but in the end accepts his love

\b0 \cf2 So many journeys may the sun and moon\
Make us again count o'er ere love be done!\
But, woe is me, you are so sick of late,\
So far from cheer and from your former state,\
That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,\
Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must:\
For women's fear and love holds quantity;\
In neither aught, or in extremity.\
Now, what my love is, proof hath made you know;\
And as my love is sized, my fear is so:\
Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;\
Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.\

\b \cf2 Player King\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 I do believe you think what now you speak;\
But what we do determine oft we break.\
Purpose is but the slave to memory,\
Of violent birth, but poor validity;\
Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree;\
But fall, unshaken, when they mellow be.\
Most necessary 'tis that we forget\
To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt:\
What to ourselves in passion we propose,\
The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.\
The violence of either grief or joy\
Their own enactures with themselves destroy:\
Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;\
Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.\
This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange\
That even our loves should with our fortunes change;\
For 'tis a question left us yet to prove,\
Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.\
The great man down, you mark his favourite flies;\
The poor advanced makes friends of enemies.\
And hitherto doth love on fortune tend;\
For who not needs shall never lack a friend,\
And who in want a hollow friend doth try,\
Directly seasons him his enemy.\
But, orderly to end where I begun,\
Our wills and fates do so contrary run\
That our devices still are overthrown;\
Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own:\
So think thou wilt no second husband wed;\
But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.\

Fix'd on the summit of the highest mount,\

Attends the boisterous ruin. Never alone\

\b0 \cf2 My lord, he's going to his mother's closet:\
Behind the arras I'll convey myself,\
To hear the process; and warrant she'll tax him home:\
And, as you said, and wisely was it said,\
'Tis meet that some more audience than a mother,\
Since nature makes them partial, should o'erhear\
The speech, of vantage. Fare you well, my liege:\
I'll call upon you ere you go to bed,\
And tell you what I know.\

\cf2 O, my offence is rank it smells to heaven;\
It hath the primal eldest curse upon't,\
A brother's murder. Pray can I not,\
Though inclination be as sharp as will:\
My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent;\
And, like a man to double business bound,\
I stand in pause where I shall first begin,\
And both neglect. What if this cursed hand\
Were thicker than itself with brother's blood,\
Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens\
To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy\
But to confront the visage of offence?\
And what's in prayer but this two-fold force,\
To be forestalled ere we come to fall,\
Or pardon'd being down? Then I'll look up;\
My fault is past. But, O, what form of prayer\
Can serve my turn? 'Forgive me my foul murder'?\
That cannot be; since I am still possess'd\
Of those effects for which I did the murder,\
My crown, mine own ambition and my queen.\
May one be pardon'd and retain the offence?\
In the corrupted currents of this world\
Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice,\
And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself\
Buys out the law: but 'tis not so above;\
There is no shuffling, there the action lies\
In his true nature; and we ourselves compell'd,\
Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults,\
To give in evidence. What then? what rests?\
Try what repentance can: what can it not?\
Yet what can it when one can not repent?\
O wretched state! O bosom black as death!\
O limed soul, that, struggling to be free,\
Art more engaged! Help, angels! Make assay!\
Bow, stubborn knees; and, heart with strings of steel,\
Be soft as sinews of the newborn babe!\
All may be well.\

And so am I revenged. That would be scann'd:\
A villain kills my father; and for that,\
I, his sole son, do this same villain send\
To heaven.\
O, this is hire and salary, not revenge.\
He took my father grossly, full of bread;\
With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;\
And how his audit stands who knows save heaven?\
But in our circumstance and course of thought,\
'Tis heavy with him: and am I then revenged,\
To take him in the purging of his soul,\
When he is fit and season'd for his passage?\
No!\
Up, sword; and know thou a more horrid hent:\
When he is drunk asleep, or in his rage,\
Or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed;\
At gaming, swearing, or about some act\
That has no relish of salvation in't;\
Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven,\
And that his soul may be as damn'd and black\
As hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays:\
This physic but prolongs thy sickly days.\

That blurs the grace and blush of modesty,\
Calls virtue hypocrite, takes off the rose\
From the fair forehead of an innocent love\
And sets a blister there, makes marriage-vows\
As false as dicers' oaths: O, such a deed\
As from the body of contraction plucks\
The very soul, and sweet religion makes\
A rhapsody of words: heaven's face doth glow:\
Yea, this solidity and compound mass,\
With tristful visage, as against the doom,\
Is thought-sick at the act.\

\b \cf2 HAMLET\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 Look here, upon this picture, and on this,\
The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.\
See, what a grace was seated on this brow;\
Hyperion's curls; the front of Jove himself;\
An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;\
A station like the herald Mercury\
New-lighted on a heaven-kissing hill;\
A combination and a form indeed,\
Where every god did seem to set his seal,\
To give the world assurance of a man:\
This was your husband. Look you now, what follows:\
Here is your husband; like a mildew'd ear,\
Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?\
Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,\
And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes?\
You cannot call it love; for at your age\
The hey-day in the blood is tame, it's humble,\
And waits upon the judgment: and what judgment\
Would step from this to this? Sense, sure, you have,\
Else could you not have motion; but sure, that sense\
Is apoplex'd; for madness would not err,\
Nor sense to ecstasy was ne'er so thrall'd\
But it reserved some quantity of choice,\
To serve in such a difference. What devil was't\
That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?\
Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,\
Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,\
Or but a sickly part of one true sense\
Could not so mope.\
O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,\
If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,\
To flaming youth let virtue be as wax,\
And melt in her own fire: proclaim no shame\
When the compulsive ardour gives the charge,\
Since frost itself as actively doth burn\
And reason panders will.\

And with the incorporal air do hold discourse?\

And, as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm,\
Your bedded hair, like life in excrements,\
Starts up, and stands on end. O gentle son,\
Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper\
Sprinkle cool patience. Whereon do you look?\

Lay not that mattering unction to your soul,\
That not your trespass, but my madness speaks:\
It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,\
Whilst rank corruption, mining all within,\
Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven;\
Repent what's past; avoid what is to come;\
And do not spread the compost on the weeds,\
To make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue;\
For in the fatness of these pursy times\

Assume a virtue, if you have it not.\
That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat,\
Of habits devil, is angel yet in this,\
That to the use of actions fair and good\
He likewise gives a frock or livery,\
That aptly is put on. Refrain to-night,\
And that shall lend a kind of easiness\
To the next abstinence: the next more easy;\
For use almost can change the stamp of nature,\
And either [ ] the devil, or throw him out\
With wondrous potency. Once more, good night:\
And when you are desirous to be bless'd,\

Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib,\
Such dear concernings hide? who would do so?\

Unpeg the basket on the house's top.\

\b0 \cf2 There's letters seal'd: and my two schoolfellows,\
Whom I will trust as I will adders fang'd,\
They bear the mandate; they must sweep my way,\
And marshal me to knavery. Let it work;\
For 'tis the sport to have the engineer\
Hoist with his own petard: and 't shall go hard\
But I will delve one yard below their mines,\
And blow them at the moon: O, 'tis most sweet,\
When in one line two crafts directly meet.\
This man shall set me packing:\
I'll lug the guts into the neighbour room.\
Mother, good night. Indeed this counsellor\
Is now most still, most secret and most grave,\
Who was in life a foolish prating knave.\
Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you.\
Good night, mother.\

\b \cf2 QUEEN GERTRUDE\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 Mad as the sea and wind, when both contend\
Which is the mightier: in his lawless fit,\
Behind the arras hearing something stir,\
Whips out his rapier, cries, 'A rat, a rat!'\
And, in this brainish apprehension, kills\
The unseen good old man.\

It had been so with us, had we been there:\
His liberty is full of threats to all;\
To you yourself, to us, to every one.\
Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answer'd?\
It will be laid to us, whose providence\
Should have kept short, restrain'd and out of haunt,\
This mad young man: but so much was our love,\
We would not understand what was most fit;\
But, like the owner of a foul disease,\
To keep it from divulging, let it feed\
Even on the pith of Life. Where is he gone?\

\b0 \cf2 Ay, sir, that soaks up the king's countenance, his\
rewards, his authorities. But such officers do the\
king best service in the end: he keeps them, like\
an ape, in the corner of his jaw; first mouthed, to\
be last swallowed: when he needs what you have\
gleaned, it is but squeezing you, and, sponge, you\
shall be dry again.\

How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!\
Yet must not we put the strong law on him:\
He's loved of the distracted multitude,\
Who like not in their judgment, but their eyes;\
And where tis so, the offender's scourge is weigh'd,\
But never the offence. To bear all smooth and even,\
This sudden sending him away must seem\
Deliberate pause: diseases desperate grown\
By desperate appliance are relieved,\
Or not at all.\

convocation of politic worms are e'en at him. Your\
worm is your only emperor for diet: we fat all\
creatures else to fat us, and we fat ourselves for\
maggots: your fat king and your lean beggar is but\

A thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom\
And ever three parts coward, I do not know\
Why yet I live to say 'This thing's to do;'\
Sith I have cause and will and strength and means\
To do't. Examples gross as earth exhort me:\
Witness this army of such mass and charge\
Led by a delicate and tender prince,\
Whose spirit with divine ambition puff'd\
Makes mouths at the invisible event,\
Exposing what is mortal and unsure\
To all that fortune, death and danger dare,\
Even for an egg-shell. Rightly to be great\
Is not to stir without great argument,\
But greatly to find quarrel in a straw\
When honour's at the stake. How stand I then,\
That have a father kill'd, a mother stain'd,\
Excitements of my reason and my blood,\
And let all sleep? while, to my shame, I see\
The imminent death of twenty thousand men,\
That, for a fantasy and trick of fame,\
Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot\
Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,\
Which is not tomb enough and continent\
To hide the slain? O, from this time forth,\
My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth!\

\b \cf2 Gentleman\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 She speaks much of her father; says she hears\
There's tricks i' the world; and hems, and beats her heart;\
Spurns enviously at straws; speaks things in doubt,\
That carry but half sense: her speech is nothing,\
Yet the unshaped use of it doth move\
The hearers to collection; they aim at it,\
And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts;\
Which, as her winks, and nods, and gestures\
yield them,\
Indeed would make one think there might be thought,\
Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.\

\cf2 O, this is the poison of deep grief; it springs\
All from her father's death. O Gertrude, Gertrude,\
When sorrows come, they come not single spies\
But in battalions. First, her father slain:\
Next, your son gone; and he most violent author\
Of his own just remove: the people muddied,\
Thick and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers,\
For good Polonius' death; and we have done but greenly,\
In hugger-mugger to inter him: poor Ophelia\
Divided from herself and her fair judgment,\
Without the which we are pictures, or mere beasts:\
Last, and as much containing as all these,\
Her brother is in secret come from France;\
Feeds on his wonder, keeps himself in clouds,\
And wants not buzzers to infect his ear\
With pestilent speeches of his father's death;\
Wherein necessity, of matter beggar'd,\
Will nothing stick our person to arraign\
In ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this,\
Like to a murdering-piece, in many places\
Gives me superfluous death.\

\b0 \cf2 Save yourself, my lord:\
The ocean, overpeering of his list,\
Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste\
Than young Laertes, in a riotous head,\
O'erbears your officers. The rabble call him lord;\
And, as the world were now but to begin,\
Antiquity forgot, custom not known,\
The ratifiers and props of every word,\
They cry 'Choose we: Laertes shall be king:'\
Caps, hands, and tongues, applaud it to the clouds:\
'Laertes shall be king, Laertes king!'\

That treason can but peep to what it would,\
Acts little of his will. Tell me, Laertes,\

this, give these fellows some means to the king:\
they have letters for him. Ere we were two days old\
at sea, a pirate of very warlike appointment gave us\
chase. Finding ourselves too slow of sail, we put on\
a compelled valour, and in the grapple I boarded\
them: on the instant they got clear of our ship; so\
I alone became their prisoner. They have dealt with\
me like thieves of mercy: but they knew what they\
did; I am to do a good turn for them. Let the king\
have the letters I have sent; and repair thou to me\
with as much speed as thou wouldst fly death. I\
have words to speak in thine ear will make thee\
dumb; yet are they much too light for the bore of\
the matter. These good fellows will bring thee\
where I am. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold their\
course for England: of them I have much to tell\
thee. Farewell.\
'He that thou knowest thine, HAMLET.'\
Come, I will make you way for these your letters;\
And do't the speedier, that you may direct me\
To him from whom you brought them.\

\b \cf2 KING CLAUDIUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 Now must your conscience my acquaintance seal,\
And you must put me in your heart for friend,\
Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,\
That he which hath your noble father slain\
Pursued my life.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 LAERTES\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 It well appears: but tell me\
Why you proceeded not against these feats,\
So crimeful and so capital in nature,\
As by your safety, wisdom, all things else,\
You mainly were stirr'd up.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 KING CLAUDIUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 O, for two special reasons;\
Which may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew'd,\
But yet to me they are strong. The queen his mother\
Lives almost by his looks; and for myself--\
My virtue or my plague, be it either which--\
She's so conjunctive to my life and soul,\
That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,\
I could not but by her. The other motive,\
Why to a public count I might not go,\
Is the great love the general gender bear him;\
Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,\
Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,\
Convert his gyves to graces; so that my arrows,\
Too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind,\
Would have reverted to my bow again,\
And not where I had aim'd them.\

\b \cf2 LAERTES\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 And so have I a noble father lost;\
A sister driven into desperate terms,\
Whose worth, if praises may go back again,\
Stood challenger on mount of all the age\
For her perfections: but my revenge will come.\

\b \cf2 KING CLAUDIUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 Break not your sleeps for that: you must not think\
That we are made of stuff so flat and dull\
That we can let our beard be shook with danger\
And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more:\
I loved your father, and we love ourself;\
And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine--\

To an exploit, now ripe in my device,\
Under the which he shall not choose but fall:\
And for his death no wind of blame shall breathe,\
But even his mother shall uncharge the practise\
And call it accident.\

\b0 \cf2 It falls right.\
You have been talk'd of since your travel much,\
And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality\
Wherein, they say, you shine: your sum of parts\
Did not together pluck such envy from him\
As did that one, and that, in my regard,\
Of the unworthiest siege.\

\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 KING CLAUDIUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 A very riband in the cap of youth,\
Yet needful too; for youth no less becomes\
The light and careless livery that it wears\
Than settled age his sables and his weeds,\
Importing health and graveness. Two months since,\
Here was a gentleman of Normandy:--\
I've seen myself, and served against, the French,\
And they can well on horseback: but this gallant\
Had witchcraft in't; he grew unto his seat;\
And to such wondrous doing brought his horse,\
As he had been incorpsed and demi-natured\
With the brave beast: so far he topp'd my thought,\
That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,\
Come short of what he did.\

\b \cf2 KING CLAUDIUS\

\b0 \cf2 He made confession of you,\
And gave you such a masterly report\
For art and exercise in your defence\
And for your rapier most especially,\
That he cried out, 'twould be a sight indeed,\
If one could match you: the scrimers of their nation,\
He swore, had had neither motion, guard, nor eye,\
If you opposed them. Sir, this report of his\
Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy\
That he could nothing do but wish and beg\
Your sudden coming o'er, to play with him.\
Now, out of this,--\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 LAERTES\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 What out of this, my lord?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 KING CLAUDIUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 Laertes, was your father dear to you?\
Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,\
A face without a heart?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 LAERTES\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 Why ask you this?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 KING CLAUDIUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 Not that I think you did not love your father;\
But that I know love is begun by time;\
And that I see, in passages of proof,\
Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.\
There lives within the very flame of love\
A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;\
And nothing is at a like goodness still;\
For goodness, growing to a plurisy,\
Dies in his own too much: that we would do\
We should do when we would; for this 'would' changes\
And hath abatements and delays as many\
As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;\
And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,\
That hurts by easing. But, to the quick o' the ulcer:--\
Hamlet comes back: what would you undertake,\
To show yourself your father's son in deed\
More than in words?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 LAERTES\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 KING CLAUDIUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 No place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize;\
Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,\
Will you do this, keep close within your chamber.\
Hamlet return'd shall know you are come home:\
We'll put on those shall praise your excellence\
And set a double varnish on the fame\
The Frenchman gave you, bring you in fine together\
And wager on your heads: he, being remiss,\
Most generous and free from all contriving,\
Will not peruse the foils; so that, with ease,\
Or with a little shuffling, you may choose\
A sword unbated, and in a pass of practise\
Requite him for your father.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 LAERTES\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 I will do't:\
And, for that purpose, I'll anoint my sword.\
I bought an unction of a mountebank,\
So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,\
Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,\
Collected from all simples that have virtue\
Under the moon, can save the thing from death\
That is but scratch'd withal: I'll touch my point\
With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,\
It may be death.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 KING CLAUDIUS\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 Let's further think of this;\
Weigh what convenience both of time and means\
May fit us to our shape: if this should fail,\
And that our drift look through our bad performance,\
'Twere better not assay'd: therefore this project\
Should have a back or second, that might hold,\
If this should blast in proof. Soft! let me see:\
We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings: I ha't.\
When in your motion you are hot and dry--\
As make your bouts more violent to that end--\
And that he calls for drink, I'll have prepared him\
A chalice for the nonce, whereon but sipping,\
If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,\
Our purpose may hold there.\

That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream;\
There with fantastic garlands did she come\
Of crow-flowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples\
That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,\
But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them:\
There, on the pendent boughs her coronet weeds\
Clambering to hang, an envious sliver broke;\
When down her weedy trophies and herself\
Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide;\
And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up:\
Which time she chanted snatches of old tunes;\
As one incapable of her own distress,\
Or like a creature native and indued\
Unto that element: but long it could not be\
Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,\
Pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay\
To muddy death.\

\b \cf2 First Clown\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 It must be 'se offendendo;' it cannot be else. For\
here lies the point: if I drown myself wittingly,\
it argues an act: and an act hath three branches: it\
is, to act, to do, to perform: argal, she drowned\
herself wittingly.\

stands the man; good; if the man go to this water,\
and drown himself, it is, will he, nill he, he\
goes,--mark you that; but if the water come to him\
and drown him, he drowns not himself: argal, he\
that is not guilty of his own death shortens not his own life.\

no more of his purchases, and double ones too, than\

To outface me with leaping in her grave?\
Be buried quick with her, and so will I:\
And, if thou prate of mountains, let them throw\
Millions of acres on us, till our ground,\
Singeing his pate against the burning zone,\

\b \cf2 HAMLET\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting,\
That would not let me sleep: methought I lay\
Worse than the mutines in the bilboes. Rashly,\
And praised be rashness for it, let us know,\
Our indiscretion sometimes serves us well,\
When our deep plots do pall: and that should teach us\
There's a divinity that shapes our ends,\
Rough-hew them how we will,--\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 HORATIO\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 HAMLET\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 Up from my cabin,\
My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark\
Groped I to find out them; had my desire.\
Finger'd their packet, and in fine withdrew\
To mine own room again; making so bold,\
My fears forgetting manners, to unseal\
Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio,--\
O royal knavery!--an exact command,\
Larded with many several sorts of reasons\
Importing Denmark's health and England's too,\
With, ho! such bugs and goblins in my life,\
That, on the supervise, no leisure bated,\
No, not to stay the grinding of the axe,\
My head should be struck off.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 HORATIO\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 HAMLET\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 Here's the commission: read it at more leisure.\
But wilt thou hear me how I did proceed?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 HORATIO\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 I beseech you.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 HAMLET\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 Being thus be-netted round with villanies,--\
Ere I could make a prologue to my brains,\
They had begun the play--I sat me down,\
Devised a new commission, wrote it fair:\
I once did hold it, as our statists do,\
A baseness to write fair and labour'd much\
How to forget that learning, but, sir, now\
It did me yeoman's service: wilt thou know\
The effect of what I wrote?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 HORATIO\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 Ay, good my lord.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 HAMLET\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 An earnest conjuration from the king,\
As England was his faithful tributary,\
As love between them like the palm might flourish,\
As peace should stiff her wheaten garland wear\
And stand a comma 'tween their amities,\
And many such-like 'As'es of great charge,\
That, on the view and knowing of these contents,\
Without debatement further, more or less,\
He should the bearers put to sudden death,\
Not shriving-time allow'd.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 HORATIO\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 HAMLET\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.\
I had my father's signet in my purse,\
Which was the model of that Danish seal;\
Folded the writ up in form of the other,\
Subscribed it, gave't the impression, placed it safely,\
The changeling never known. Now, the next day\
Was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent\
Thou know'st already.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 HORATIO\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 HAMLET\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 Why, man, they did make love to this employment;\
They are not near my conscience; their defeat\
Does by their own insinuation grow:\
'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes\
Between the pass and fell incensed points\
Of mighty opposites.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 HORATIO\

\b \cf2 HAMLET\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 Does it not, think'st thee, stand me now upon--\
He that hath kill'd my king and whored my mother,\
Popp'd in between the election and my hopes,\
Thrown out his angle for my proper life,\
And with such cozenage--is't not perfect conscience,\
To quit him with this arm? and is't not to be damn'd,\
To let this canker of our nature come\
In further evil?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 HORATIO\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

What is the issue of the business there.\

\b \cf2 HAMLET\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 It will be short: the interim is mine;\
And a man's life's no more than to say 'One.'\
But I am very sorry, good Horatio,\
That to Laertes I forgot myself;\
For, by the image of my cause, I see\
The portraiture of his: I'll court his favours.\
But, sure, the bravery of his grief did put me\
Into a towering passion.\

beast be lord of beasts, and his crib shall stand at\

spacious in the possession of dirt.\

\b \cf2 OSRIC\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 HAMLET\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 OSRIC\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry,--as\
'twere,--I cannot tell how. But, my lord, his\
majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a\
great wager on your head: sir, this is the matter,--\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 HAMLET\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 I beseech you, remember--\

\b \cf2 OSRIC\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 Nay, good my lord; for mine ease, in good faith.\
Sir, here is newly come to court Laertes; believe\
me, an absolute gentleman, full of most excellent\
differences, of very soft society and great showing:\
indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card or\
calendar of gentry, for you shall find in him the\
continent of what part a gentleman would see.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 HAMLET\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you;\
though, I know, to divide him inventorially would\
dizzy the arithmetic of memory, and yet but yaw\
neither, in respect of his quick sail. But, in the\
verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of\
great article; and his infusion of such dearth and\
rareness, as, to make true diction of him, his\
semblable is his mirror; and who else would trace\
him, his umbrage, nothing more.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 OSRIC\

\b \cf2 HAMLET\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did,\
it would not much approve me. Well, sir?\

\b \cf2 OSRIC\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 HAMLET\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with\
him in excellence; but, to know a man well, were to\
know himself.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 OSRIC\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation\
laid on him by them, in his meed he's unfellowed.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 HAMLET\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 What's his weapon?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 OSRIC\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 Rapier and dagger.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 HAMLET\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 OSRIC\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 The king, sir, hath wagered with him six Barbary\
horses: against the which he has imponed, as I take\
it, six French rapiers and poniards, with their\
assigns, as girdle, hangers, and so: three of the\
carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy, very\
responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages,\
and of very liberal conceit.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 HAMLET\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 HAMLET\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 The phrase would be more german to the matter, if we\
could carry cannon by our sides: I would it might\
be hangers till then. But, on: six Barbary horses\
against six French swords, their assigns, and three\
liberal-conceited carriages; that's the French bet\
against the Danish. Why is this 'imponed,' as you call it?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 OSRIC\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 The king, sir, hath laid, that in a dozen passes\
between yourself and him, he shall not exceed you\
three hits: he hath laid on twelve for nine; and it\
would come to immediate trial, if your lordship\
would vouchsafe the answer.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

the foils be brought, the gentleman willing, and the\
king hold his purpose, I will win for him an I can;\

\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 He did comply with his dug, before he sucked it.\
Thus has he--and many more of the same bevy that I\
know the dressy age dotes on--only got the tune of\
the time and outward habit of encounter; a kind of\
yesty collection, which carries them through and\
through the most fond and winnowed opinions; and do\
but blow them to their trial, the bubbles are out.\

\b0 \cf2 My lord, his majesty commended him to you by young\
Osric, who brings back to him that you attend him in\
the hall: he sends to know if your pleasure hold to\
play with Laertes, or that you will take longer time.\

\b \cf2 HAMLET\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

pleasure: if his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now\
or whensoever, provided I be so able as now.\

have been in continual practise: I shall win at the\
odds. But thou wouldst not think how ill all's here\
about my heart: but it is no matter.\

\b \cf2 HAMLET\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 Not a whit, we defy augury: there's a special\
providence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be now,\
'tis not to come; if it be not to come, it will be\
now; if it be not now, yet it will come: the\
readiness is all: since no man has aught of what he\
leaves, what is't to leave betimes?\

\b0 \cf2 Give me your pardon, sir: I've done you wrong;\
But pardon't, as you are a gentleman.\
This presence knows,\
And you must needs have heard, how I am punish'd\
With sore distraction. What I have done,\
That might your nature, honour and exception\
Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.\
Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet:\
If Hamlet from himself be ta'en away,\
And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,\
Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.\
Who does it, then? His madness: if't be so,\
Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd;\
His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.\
Sir, in this audience,\
Let my disclaiming from a purposed evil\
Free me so far in your most generous thoughts,\
That I have shot mine arrow o'er the house,\
And hurt my brother.\

\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 I am satisfied in nature,\
Whose motive, in this case, should stir me most\
To my revenge: but in my terms of honour\
I stand aloof; and will no reconcilement,\
Till by some elder masters, of known honour,\
I have a voice and precedent of peace,\
To keep my name ungored. But till that time,\
I do receive your offer'd love like love,\
And will not wrong it.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 HAMLET\

Stick fiery off indeed.\

\b0 \cf2 Set me the stoops of wine upon that table.\
If Hamlet give the first or second hit,\
Or quit in answer of the third exchange,\
Let all the battlements their ordnance fire:\
The king shall drink to Hamlet's better breath;\
And in the cup an union shall he throw,\
Richer than that which four successive kings\
In Denmark's crown have worn. Give me the cups;\
And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,\
The trumpet to the cannoneer without,\
The cannons to the heavens, the heavens to earth,\
'Now the king dunks to Hamlet.' Come, begin:\
And you, the judges, bear a wary eye.\

\b0 \cf2 The sight is dismal;\
And our affairs from England come too late:\
The ears are senseless that should give us hearing,\
To tell him his commandment is fulfill'd,\
That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead:\
Where should we have our thanks?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 HORATIO\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 Not from his mouth,\
Had it the ability of life to thank you:\
He never gave commandment for their death.\
But since, so jump upon this bloody question,\
You from the Polack wars, and you from England,\
Are here arrived give order that these bodies\
High on a stage be placed to the view;\
And let me speak to the yet unknowing world\
How these things came about: so shall you hear\
Of carnal, bloody, and unnatural acts,\
Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters,\
Of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause,\
And, in this upshot, purposes mistook\
Fall'n on the inventors' reads: all this can I\
Truly deliver.\

\b \cf2 PRINCE FORTINBRAS\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 Let us haste to hear it,\
And call the noblest to the audience.\
For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune:\
I have some rights of memory in this kingdom,\
Which now to claim my vantage doth invite me.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 HORATIO\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 Of that I shall have also cause to speak,\
And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more;\
But let this same be presently perform'd,\
Even while men's minds are wild; lest more mischance\
On plots and errors, happen.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 PRINCE FORTINBRAS\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\b0 \cf2 Let four captains\
Bear Hamlet, like a soldier, to the stage;\
For he was likely, had he been put on,\
To have proved most royally: and, for his passage,\
The soldiers' music and the rites of war\
Speak loudly for him.\
Take up the bodies: such a sight as this\
Becomes the field, but here shows much amiss.\
Go, bid the soldiers shoot.\

\i \cf2 A dead march. Exeunt, bearing off the dead bodies; after which a peal of ordnance is shot off
